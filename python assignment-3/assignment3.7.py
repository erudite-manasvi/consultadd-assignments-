# Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects. Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.

def map_list_to_dict(l1,l2):
    if len(l1)!=len(l2):
        return "Mapping can't be done"
    
    res =  zip(l1, l2)

    return dict(res)

def map_list_to_dict2(l1,l2):
    if len(l1)!=len(l2):
        return "Mapping can't be done"
    
    res =  {l1[i]:l2[i] for i in range(len(l1))}

    return res
    
l1 = ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Mona']
l2 = ['Commerce', 'Science', 'Computer']

print(map_list_to_dict2(l1,l2))
